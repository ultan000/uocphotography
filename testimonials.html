   			<p>Ultan has a very professional attitude, while still being very easy-going and relaxed. He put me and my husband at ease right away and helped make our day so special. We never felt like we were away from our guests for too long doing a photoshoot. Everything was very candid, and he captured all of the highlights of the day. Definitely would recommend!</p>

			<p>I couldn't recommend Ultan more. The day ran so smoothly and we never felt he was putting us under any pressure. We couldn't believe the quality of the photos that we got and the album turned out beautiful. Thank you so much Ultan.</p>

			<p>I asked Ultan for a headshot for an acting college application. The lengths that he went to to make sure that all the criteria for the application was met, and that there were plenty of different poses and styles to choose from. I would highly recommend Ultan for any headshot needs!

			<p>I couldn't ask for any more from a photographer. Quick and painless! I was dreading getting my headshot taken as I found it so tedious before. But Ultan got the job done efficiently, without rushing me out the door. Highly recommend him!

			<p>Hands down, the only photographer I will go to now. He was patient with me (I find it hard to relax and pose), and eased me into the whole thing. I was able to relax and get a photo that I really love. I'm actually looking forward to getting the next one. Thanks Ultan.
